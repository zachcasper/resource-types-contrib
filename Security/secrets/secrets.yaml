      The Radius.Security/secrets Resource Type stores sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, keys, and certificates. To create a new Secret, start by adding parameter to your application definition decorated with `@secure()`. Then add a `secrets` resource. Never include secret values in an application definition. 

      ```
      extension radius
      extension secrets

      @description('The Radius environment ID. Typically set by the Radius CLI.')
      param environment

      @secure()
      param password string

      resource myApplication 'Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myApplication'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
        }
      }

      resource credentials 'Radius.Security/secrets@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'credentials'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          data: {
            username: {
              value: admin
            }
            password: {
              value: password
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      For details on how to use the secret with another resource such as a container or database, see the documentation for those resource types.
